For electricity price per customer, I analyzed the national dataset found at the following link:

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table6.pdf

In order to obtain an accurate cost per customer, I used R to compute the weighted mean
which took into account the price per kilowatt hour charged by each company, and the amount
of customers each company had.

For water cost, I could not find an accurate national dataset, so instead I chose to implement
the tiered water rate system used by Birmingham Water, found at the link below:
